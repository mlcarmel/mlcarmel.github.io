      About Me
    </h2>
    
    <p style="color:gold;""> Hello! I'm Margaret Carmel. I am the Senior Reporter with BoiseDev.com, a locally owned news start up in Boise, Idaho. I cover city government, politics, the Idaho Legislature, housing, homelessness, growth and economics. Prior to coming to BoiseDev, I was the Boise City Hall Reporter at the Idaho Press and I also worked at The News & Advance in Lynchburg, Virginia. In Virginia, I covered business, economic development, two rural counties and then eventually Lychburg City Hall. I earned my undergraduate degree in Broadcast Journalism with minors in International Social Justice and Middle Eastern Studies from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2016. My favorite past times include reading, writing and exploring Idaho's wilderness.

      Sometimes I do long-term investigations that require multiple interviews and governmetn documents from multiple sources. This story also required lots of off the record conversations with water lawyers and other experts.

      I also do accountability journalism on a much smaller scale. This is one example of how I have reported on developments in Boise being conditioned by the city to be built a certain way only for residents to learn that's not the case once it's finished.

      Another aspect of my job is covering the day-to-day business of governing when difficult problems arise in Boise. This article is the latest in my reporting on downtown business complaints about "The Cruise", a tradition where people in high performance cars drive circles around Boise, and how the government is trying to create effective rules to stop the situation without infringing on someone's rights.
